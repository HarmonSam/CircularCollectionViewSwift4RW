Updating RayWenderlich's spinning wheel custom collectionview tutorial to a working state

This project is basically a simple effort to get the following tutorial to a working Swift 4 state where it can then be edited for your own needs

You can find the original tutorial here : https://www.raywenderlich.com/107687/uicollectionview-custom-layout-tutorial-spinning-wheel

Things that I had to do in order to get it to work:
1. Remove the reference to the images from the folder that they were in (not sure why they were not in an assets folder) and just add it manually
2. Update all of the collectionview delegate/data source functions to their new versions
3. Change some references in the nib file

I had noticed that the topic on the raywenderlich website had been closed and I thought it might be useful for people still interested in making something like that to have a more up-to-date jumping off point.
